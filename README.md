## Design Choices

### 1. **User Interface (UI)**
- Used simple and clean layouts for forms.
- Included a visually distinct button for actions (e.g., Login, Signup).
- Highlighted error messages for better user feedback.

### 2. **Functionality**
- Used `Formik` and `Yup` to separate form logic and validation from UI components.
